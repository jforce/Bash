Bash/IMDb Movie Collection Script (bashmcs) version 0.7


The script is rather simple. just chmod +x movies.sh, edit the folder="", run it.

Requirements: wget, dos2unix and egrep, ffmpeg




----> CHANGELOG:

* 20.03.10
-	Added a good looking webui that uses CSS and style to make it look good. Its also XHTML-approved. (check yourself) Special thanks to waf@freak.no
-	Improved the code a little.
- 	Added a html_folder="" - so you can choose where you want your results.
-	Added A function that also prints the video-file information if its present in the directory.

* 04.03.10
-	I added support for nfo-files. allowing you to retain the old name of the movie.
-	Added a counter that checks how many folders it is going to go trough, and how far its gotten. (see example below)
-	Added colors to the script output.
-	Changed a large portion of the script in order to implementate a case function instead of if, since if would not always work.






-----> TODO:

	* High priority:
- Clean up and remove old unused code. (just wanted this to get out on the interwebz) ;) 
- Add options to add more folders to check.

	* Medium Priority: 
- Add a function that allows the script to check all files in the specified directory (not just directories)
- Clean up the code even more, remove any unnececary pipes and such. It would probably take a second off a 15 minute wait. but still.
- Add a "This page was created in $used_time seconds/minutes/hours"

	* Low priority:
- Figure out how to deal with incorrectly written URLs in the nfos. (its not really my problem, so its given a low priority) 





-----> KNOWN BUGS: 

google-search: Sometimes google will FIND the actual movie, but ends up in a different location on imdb like www.imdb.com/title/tt192827/alternatemovies/
Not Found: most of the times when you are issued a "not found" messages, the reason is because the nfo-file have written the url wrong, like http://www.imdb.com/Title/tt817237. (see low Priority todo)

Others: none known.
